## A small guessing game

Inspired by BANDAI's Tamagotchi Gen 2 built-in mini-game.

I love Tamagotchi, and I love it's built in mini-game too, which is about to guess and it also has some luck in it, so I made it because I was bored.

All you need to do, is to guess if the upcoming number will be less or greater than the number was shown to you.
The program counts the hits and misses, and also calculates the accuracy ratio of your guesses.

Program accepts the following inputs which are also prompted interactively:

* `l`: less
* `g`: greater
* `x`: exit game
* `Return (Enter key)`: continue to next stage or confirm the above inputs
* `Ctrl + C`: interrupt the program
